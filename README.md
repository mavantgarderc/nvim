# Neovim Configuration
Rebuild of my Vim setup on Nvim from scratch; nothing more...
& ofcourse a lil' bit of modernization... or more :)

## Notes
### Keymaps
Keymaps are modularized to help the user engage; good for memorization.

You'll see three types:
1. Plugin related keymaps, located in `lua/plugins/{plugin_config_file}`
2. Nvim keymaps located in `lua/core/keymaps/`, categorized:
  - Customs
  - Native Re-implementations
This structures allow the user to read the config modules, as a reference study.

I'll appreciate any recommendations if you do by [gmail](manihabibinava@gmail.com).

> [!NOTE] F-Keys
> They are available for OGs, but not a good idea to take the habbit (for sake of zen).
