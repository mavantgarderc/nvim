# Neovim Configuration

> Hagakure

A wandering soul with a Vim config, now rebuilding it from scratch in Neovim.

The goal is to keep the spirit, upgrade the sword — sharpened with Lua and modern tooling.

### Iaijutsu Sword Attacks - Dance of the Sword
Keymaps are modularized for clarity and ease of discovery — AuDHD-friendly by design.

Designed to be both informative and self-guiding.

You'll see three types at `lua/core/keymaps/`:
- Customs
- Native Re-implementations
- Plugin Keymaps

This structure allows the user to explore mappings as standalone modules and reference points.

> F-Keys are available for OGs, but not a habit worth building (for the sake of zen).

### Kendos Sword Schools - Techniques & Forms
*Kendo* means *The Way of The Sword*.

Among La Italia's finest painters, Raphael stood out for his harmony in color — just like your interface should.

#### `Raphael/`
Theme management with auto & user commands (astigmatist heaven)
- FileType theme appliance; toggle to turn off.
- Live theme-selector.
- TODO: Integrations with Ghostty & Starship.
- TODO: TOML & Hex Code support, powered by [Base16](https://github.com/RRethy/base16-nvim); TOML parser, etc. needed.

#### `lsp/`
Modular Per-language LSP Configuration; extensible & usage specific
  - Add your language server's config to `lua/lsp/servers/`, then inject to `lua/lsp/shared.lua`.

Inspired by out-of-the-box Lua-based distros:
  - ~~NvChad~~
  - ~~Kickstart~~
  - ~~LunarVim~~

###  Yoroi of the Sword Master - Tools of Warlike
*Yoroi* means *Samurai Equipments*.

> Full plugin config lives in `lua/plugins/`, modularized by purpose & intent.

> This config uses [`lazy.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) for plugin loading and startup optimization.
Plugins are lazy-loaded, organized under `lua/plugins/`, and grouped by function.

`plugins/`: configured like a blade — swift, silent, and aligned in purpose
  - [`colorizer.nvim`](https://github.com/norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua): Inline hex/rgb coloring
  - [`dadbod.nvim`](https://github.com/tpope/vim-dadbod): UI + cmp: SQL interaction with RDBMS systems (Postgres, Oracle, SSMS, etc.)
  - [`flash.nvim`](https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim): Navigate precisely - no more `H/J/K/L` spam
  - [`gitsigns.nvim`](https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim): Stage hunks, view diffs, navigate history — buffer-local
  - [`lualine.nvim`](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim): Custom tabline/statusline with style
  - [`undotree.nvim`](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree): Visual undo/redo timeline
  - [`impatient.nvim`](https://github.com/lewis6991/impatient.nvim): Speeds up startup by caching Lua modules rather than search through the entire `runtimepath`

And of course: Telescope, cmp, luasnip, DAP — the usual suspects.
