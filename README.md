# Neovim Configuration
Rebuild of my Vim setup on Nvim from scratch; nothing more...
& ofcourse a lil' bit of modernization... or more :)

## Notes
### Keymaps
Keymaps are modularized to help the user engage; good for memorization.

You'll see three types:
1. Plugin related keymaps, located in `lua/plugins/{plugin_config_file}`
2. Nvim keymaps located in `lua/core/keymaps/`, categorized:
    - Customs
    - Native Re-implementations
This structures allow the user to read the config modules, as a reference study.

I'll appreciate any recommendations if you do by [gmail](manihabibinava@gmail.com).

> F-Keys are availablr for OGs, but not a good idea to take the habit (for sake of zen).

Raphael: Selecting & changing theme & filetype logic + related keymaps
- Mava loves La Italia. Big Three of La Italia's Painting are: da Vinci, Michelangelo, & Rapheal...
- Raphael was the best at harmonious paintings & colorings...

`lsp/`: Modular Per-language LSP Configuration; extensible & usage specific

`.editorconfig`: Cross-IDE style constraints to avoid conflicts with other devs & IDEs like Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.

Used out-of-the-box nvim distros & their lua-scripted features:
  - ~~NvChad~~
  - ~~Kickstart~~
  - ~~LunarVim~~
