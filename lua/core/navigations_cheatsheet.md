**Tips for AuDHD Users**:
- **Focus**: Use `<leader>zi` to check fold status or `<leader>ml` for marks when overwhelmed.
- **Consistency**: `<leader>` prefix is consistent; group similar actions (e.g., `<leader>t*` for tabs).
- **Feedback**: Use enhanced mark commands (`<leader>mM`, `<leader>JM`) for visual confirmation.
- **Simplify**: Try `<leader>zfc` to toggle fold column for visual cues or `<leader>zt` to toggle folding.
